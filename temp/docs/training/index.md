# Training courses

CERN ASIC Support offers training workshops developed in collaboration with
Cadence VCAD Services on topics of interests for people working in
microelectronics for the HEP community. These are typically held on-site at
CERN and involve lectures and hands-on lab activities, where trainees are able
to immediately put in practice what they learned. Here's what we offer:
