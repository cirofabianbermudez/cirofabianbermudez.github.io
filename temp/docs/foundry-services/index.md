# MPW and Small Volume Production services

![Image title](../assets/images/europractice3.png){ align=left width=600}

<br>

CERN offers to organize MPW runs to help keep the cost of fabricating 
prototypes and of small-volume production low by enabling multiple participants
to share production overhead costs.

CERN has established working relationships with [EUROPRACTICE IC Service]() 
and [Globalfoundries]() for acquiring cost effective access to advanced 
technology foundry services.

CERN offers to organize the fabrication of low-volume production quantities
for mature ASIC designs.
