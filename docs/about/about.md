# About Me

I am an electronic engineer who, over the past few year focused his carer
on ASIC verification. I enjoy programming and building automation tools that
speed up repetitive tasks so I can spend more time coding (yes, more programming 😄),
learning, and exploring new interesting topics such as physics, cryptography.

This website is where I share some of my projects and personal interests. I hope you find something interesting here and perhaps learn something new along the way.
